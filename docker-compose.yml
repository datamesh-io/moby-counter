  # === Dotmesh configuration follows ===
  #
  # "dm" means dotmesh.  Specifying a volume_driver tells Docker to use dotmesh
  # for all Docker volumes for this container.

  volume_driver: dm

  # The "<name>:<mountpoint>" syntax asks dotmesh for the dot called <name> and
  # mounts it into the docker container at <mountpoint>.
  #
  # In this case the dot is called "moby_counter", which is the same name as
  # the app because dots can capture the entire state of your app.

  volumes:
   - "moby_counter:/data"
